For Part 2,
1. Go into runner.c and change all ./sample2 to whichever file to test.
2. Then run make to compile.
3. Call ./runner to execute the program.
4. The results will be appended to results.txt. Results.txt will be created everytime runner.c runs, so delete it before running runner.c everytime
